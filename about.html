        <h2>Goals and Purpose</h2>

        <p> Our goal with this project is to save the lives of people who do not have the luxury of visiting a
             medical professional. <br>
             We hope to assist those in dire need by giving them the 
             convenience of knowing what sort of illness they might have. 
            </p>

        <h2> Preventative Care</h2>
        <p> With out cutting-edge technology, we have created a machine 
            that can instantly compile 
            and predict what kind of problems a patient has.</p>

        <h2> Responsive Care</h2>
        <p> Once a patient becomes ill, they can use our website to analyze and understand the dangers of their illness.</p>
