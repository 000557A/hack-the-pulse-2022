        <h2>Goals and Purpose</h2>

        <p> Our goal with this project is to save the lives of people who do not have the luxury of visiting a
             medical professional. <br>
             We hope to assist those in dire need by giving them the 
             convenience of knowing what sort of illness they might have. <br> 
            With out cutting-edge technology, we have created a machine 
            that can instantly compile 
            and predict what kind of problem a patient has.</p>
