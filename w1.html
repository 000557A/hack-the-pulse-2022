                <h2>Goals and Purpose</h2>
                    <p>
                    Our goal with this project is to aid people living in troubling situations to stay aware of their health. 
                    We use the bare minimum code and number of files so that the site is more accessible from any device. 
                    We focus on 2 parts of the user's health. Preventive and responsive.

                    Through our basic diagnostic tool, our BMI calculator, and our sleep calculator, we hope to improve the lives of people around the world. A key value to us that we need to use our talents and skills to improve the community around us.

                    That is why we have developed this website.

                <h3>  Preventive Care</h3>
                <p>With efficient use of technology, we have created a website that 
                 can help a person remain in the know with their health. Our preventive care measure 
                 are based on long-term methods. These methods include a sleep-tracker that records the users sleep patterns so 
                 that we can analyze if the user is having irregular sleep patterns. We also check the user's BMI. We use BMI instead of weight so that people do not feel bad about their bodies.
                 Helping people manage their sleep and maintain a healthy BMI should help keep people healthy. But when people do get sick our responsive care section steps in.

            <h3>  Responsive Care</h3>
            <p>Being ill due to a cold is something many of us has experienced. However, feeling sick and ill can sometimes be an underlying problem!
                With our program, it is able to inform the user of potential sicknesses and illnesses they could be infected with. Not only is our solution simple and concise, it provides the user with information very quickly.
