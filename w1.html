                    <p>
                    Our goal with this project is to aid people living in troubling situations to stay aware of their health. 
                    We use the bare minimum code and number of files so that the site is more accessible from any device. 
                    We focus on 2 parts of the user's health. Preventive and responsive.

                <h3>  Preventive Care</h3>
                <p>With efficient use of technology, we have created a website that 
                 can help a person remain in the know with their health. Our preventive care measure 
                 are based on long-term methods. These methods include a sleep-tracker that records the users sleep patterns so 
                 that we can analyze if the user is having irregular sleep patterns. We also check the user's BMI. We use BMI instead of weight so that people do not feel bad about their bodies.
                 Helping people manage their sleep and maintain a healthy BMI should help keep people healthy. But when people do get sick our responsive care section steps in.

            <h3>  Responsive Care</h3>
            <p>Once a patient becomes ill or sick or site allows them to look at what different symtoms mean.</p>
